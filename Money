Practical Considerations
Start Simple: For early-stage platforms, 
    Stripe or PayPal 
        typically provides all the necessary tools and KYC options.
Scale for Compliance: As user earnings grow, consider implementing more robust KYC/AML and tax reporting tools like 
    Jumio, Trulioo, or Tipalti.
Regional Compliance: For international payments, consider global providers like 
    Adyen or Tipalti that handle regional taxes and currency conversion.
